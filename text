* the reason
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51974369/hashrouter-vs-browserrouter

we are deployed the client & server in the same origin
so we need to make server side cannot read the client's url, cause if server side
read the url then it will try to do get method of the url
so in that case we need to use HashRouter

If we use node server, BrowserRouter will be working cause node can understand that.
but for others, we need to use HashRouter
